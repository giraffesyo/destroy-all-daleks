# UI

Notes:  
The UI package is a prefab that should be able to be attached to a scene.
The minimap camera is actually below the rooms, incase we want to put roofs or tall rooms
Sound files are are inside Resources because unity allows a method to locate files but must be in Resource folder

## Work that needs to be done:

- Music Toggle doesn't turn off music yet
- There are a lot of dalek audio options, not sure about human
- Start screen needs option to select male or female player

## Known Bugs:
 - The player's shadow only shows the gun
 - Minimap left / right are inverted
 - High rotation speeds leads to dalek leaning backwards / sideways

## Fixed Bugs:
